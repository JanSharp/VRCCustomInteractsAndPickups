- [x] interact script
  - [ ] probably an abstract base class or something
  - [x] interact text
  - [ ] proximity, working the same way as pickups described below
- [ ] pickup script
  - [x] require kinematic rigid bodies
  - [x] pickup on desktop, longest range
  - [ ] pickup in vr at a medium distance, using a ray cast directly from the hand tracking position
  - [ ] pickup in vr through close proximity, a sphere cast at the hand tracking position
  - [x] proper tooltip
  - [x] pickupable objects are identified through colliders with the Pickup layer
  - [x] the pickup colliders can be on children of the root object
  - [ ] option for restricted pickups, which enables the use of a user provided function which takes the position and rotation the object would have if it was not restricted, and returns the position and rotation it is allowed to have
  - [ ] most likely expose the position and rotation offset from the hand to the object (on desktop it would be from the head to the object)
- [x] add an fresnel effect to interactive objects when they are in reach
- [ ] when multiple objects are in reach, pick the closest one
  - [ ] preferably determined using ray cast distance or some other api to find the closest point on the object
- [ ] possibly customizable highlight color per object
- [ ] force interact objects to be on the interactive layer
- [ ] support multiple interact scripts on one object, there's a few options:
  - simply allow multiple on an object and arbitrarily choose one which controls proximity and text
  - allow multiple but have a "component priority" where the script with highest priority controls the interact settings, but this has likely confusing UX
  - allow multiple but give the user the option to choose which one is used, which requires some editor scripting gymnastics especially when prefabs are involved
  - only allow one and have it have "child" or "chained" interact scripts which also get triggered when the main one does
- [ ] force pickup objects to be on the pickup layer
- [ ] only allow one pickup script per object
- [ ] disallow interact and pickup scripts to be on the same object
- [ ] maybe a desktop key bind to highlight all interactive objects, mainly for debugging
- [ ] make sure to null check everything that's held while foreign code could run since objects could get destroyed
- [ ] maybe support modifying the exact grip transform at runtime
