- [x] interact script
  - [ ] probably an abstract base class or something
  - [x] interact text
  - [x] proximity, working the same way as pickups described below
- [ ] pickup script
  - [x] require kinematic rigid bodies
  - [x] pickup on desktop, longest range
  - [x] pickup in vr at a medium distance, using a ray cast directly from the hand tracking position
  - [x] pickup in vr through close proximity, a sphere cast at the hand tracking position
  - [x] proper tooltip
  - [x] pickupable objects are identified through colliders with the Pickup layer
  - [x] the pickup colliders can be on children of the root object
  - [ ] option for restricted pickups, which enables the use of a user provided function which takes the position and rotation the object would have if it was not restricted, and returns the position and rotation it is allowed to have
  - [x] raising events
    - [x] pickup event
    - [x] drop event
    - [x] use down event
    - [x] use up event
    - [ ] rotation changed event
  - [ ] desktop rotation
  - [x] use text
  - [x] api
    - [x] isHeld
    - [x] heldHand
    - [ ] setting held items...
  - [x] most likely expose the position and rotation offset from the hand to the object (on desktop it would be from the head to the object)
  - [ ] improve api. Just like make it better idk
- [x] add an fresnel effect to interactive objects when they are in reach
- [x] when multiple objects are in reach, pick the closest one
  - [x] preferably determined using ray cast distance or some other api to find the closest point on the object
- [ ] possibly customizable highlight color per object
- [ ] force interact objects to be on the interactive layer
- [ ] support multiple interact scripts on one object, there's a few options:
  - simply allow multiple on an object and arbitrarily choose one which controls proximity and text
  - allow multiple but have a "component priority" where the script with highest priority controls the interact settings, but this has likely confusing UX
  - allow multiple but give the user the option to choose which one is used, which requires some editor scripting gymnastics especially when prefabs are involved
  - only allow one and have it have "child" or "chained" interact scripts which also get triggered when the main one does
- [ ] force pickup objects to be on the pickup layer
- [x] only allow one pickup script per object
- [ ] disallow interact and pickup scripts to be on the same object
- [ ] maybe a desktop key bind to highlight all interactive objects, mainly for debugging
- [ ] make sure to null check everything that's held while foreign code could run since objects could get destroyed
- [ ] maybe support modifying the exact grip transform at runtime
- [x] calculate max raycast length, instead of just blindly using 100
- [ ] teleport dummy vrc pickups to the hand when interacting or picking up something to prevent interaction with vrc interacts, vrc pickups or UIs when interacting or holding one of the custom interacts/pickups
- [ ] handle null interactText and useText

# VR Testing

- [ ] what is the rotation of hand tracking data?
- [ ] pointing at interactive objects
- [ ] interacting with near objects
